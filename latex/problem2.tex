The cost: the expected size of the fire on $d$-dimensional lattice is
\[
  C_{fire}  \propto
  \sum_{i=1}{N_{sites}}
    p_i a_i
\]

The constraint for building and maintining $(d - 1)$-dimensional firewalls in $d$-dimensions is

\[
  C_{firewalls} \propto
  \sum_{i=1}^{N_{sites}}
    a_i^{
      (d - 1)/d
    }
    a_i^{-1}
\]
