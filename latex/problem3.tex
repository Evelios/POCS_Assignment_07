I was able to code up the HOT model of the lighning prone square forest farm stead. I have the model running with a grid size of $L=32$ and with the design parameters of $D = {1, 2, L, L^2}$.

(a) The plot of the forests at approximate peak yield for the simulation

(b) The yield curves for all of the design parameters that were run

(c) The distribution of forest sizes for the different design parameters that were run
